Rate My Dorm York University, is a platform where students can share reviews and rate their dorms that they have lived in. 
The goal is to help other students find the best dorm for their needs and lifestyles. Students can give feedback on things
like cleanliness, facilities, noise levels, how social the dorm is, and their overall experience. With real reviews from 
experienced students, it will be easier for others to pick a dorm where they’ll feel comfortable and happy.
